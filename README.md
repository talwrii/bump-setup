A command-line tool to bump the version in-place in `setup.py` or `pyproject.yaml` for python projects. It can bump major, minor or patch versions.

Most of the value for this is dealing with `setup.py`. If you only use `pyproject.yaml` exclusively I might recommend creating your own script since this is a very straight forward task, but this code works.

## Motivaiton
I got bored of bumping versions but hand so made this tool.

## Alternatives and prior work
There is a tool called [bumpversion](https://github.com/peritus/bumpversion) which is quite similar but wants to take the files that get modified and also seems to want you to specify the file.


## Installation
You can install `bump-setup`  using [pipx](https://github.com/pypa/pipx):

```bash
pip install bump-setup
```
## Usage
To bump the version in setup.py, run the following command:
```bash
bump-setup <major|minor|patch>
```
## Examples
```bash
bump-setup major  # Increments the major version
bump-setup minor  # Increments the minor version
bump-setup patch  # Increments the patch version
```

## Attribution
This uses the python `tree-sitter` and `tree-sitter-python` libraries to modify and parse source code while leaving whitespace intact. I did some vibe coding because I am lazy. I'm not sure it helped much since I then had to fix a bunch of bugs by hand!

I am **@readwithai**. I create tools for reading, research and agency sometimes using the markdown editor [Obsidian](https://readwithai.substack.com/p/what-exactly-is-obsidian).

I also create a [stream of tools](https://readwithai.substack.com/p/my-productivity-tools) that are related to carrying out my work. There are various python tools here.

I write about lots of things - including tools like this - on [X](https://x.com/readwithai).
My [blog](https://readwithai.substack.com/) is more about reading and research and agency.
