A command-line tool to bump the version in place a `setup.py`  bumping major, minor, or patch versions.

## Motivaiton
I got bored of bumping versions but hand so made this tool.

## Alternatives and prior work
There is a tool called [bumpversion](https://github.com/peritus/bumpversion) which is quite similar but wants to take the files that get modified.


## Installation
You can install `bump-setup`  using [pipx](https://github.com/pypa/pipx):

```bash
pip install bump-setup
```
## Usage
To bump the version in setup.py, run the following command:
```bash
bump-setup <major|minor|patch>
```
## Examples
```bash
bump-setup major  # Increments the major version
bump-setup minor  # Increments the minor version
bump-setup patch  # Increments the patch version
```
